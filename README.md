# Stream List

simple web app that show upcoming and live streams for certain streamer on youtube. Both frontend and backend are host in https://render.com/. The site URL: https://stream-list-frontend.onrender.com/

## Stack

- Frontend: Vite, Typescript, React
- Backend: Go
- External API: youtube data api

## Current issues

- Since I am using free tier on render, it take up to a minute to boot up the backend so it take awhile until the site load.
- Quota limit on youtue data api
